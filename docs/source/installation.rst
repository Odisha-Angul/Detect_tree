Building Detectree2 
*******************

==============================
Getting up and running quickly 
==============================

For users wanting to run detectree2 only it is possible to install detectree2 and its dependencies with Conda. This assumes CUDA 11.1 compatibility. Simply do::

    conda install -c ma595 detectree2

=========
Using pip
=========

It is easy to install detectree2 on your own system with Pip.

First install ``pytorch``, and ``torchvision``. Follow `https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/`_ to get compatible version for your system (with or without GPU support). By default, ``pip install torch torchvision``, will install compatible versions for CPU and GPU with CUDA 10.2 support. It is possible to point to pre-built wheels that are compatible with your system / GPU see `https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/support-matrix/index.html`_.  Below we point to the CUDA 11.1 wheel.

This can be done inside ``virtualenv`` (if root access is unavailable)::

  python3 -m venv ./venv # (check version of python is sufficiently high >=3.7, required by detectron2)
  . venv/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install wheel
  pip install torch==1.10 torchvision==0.11.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html

Then install detectron2 either from a wheel::

  pip install detectron2==0.6 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/index.html

Or from source (for unsupported CUDA versions)::
  
  python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'

Then point to preinstalled GDAL header files (not necessary if include directory is already in your path)::

  export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
  export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal

Depending on the version of setuptools installed, it may be necessary to downgrade to install GDAL. This may in the process break pytorch. 

Then simply pip install and all remaining dependencies will be installed automatically::

  git clone git@github.com:PatBall1/detectree2.git
  cd detectree2
  pip install .  # (add -e flag to allow editable installs)

Or::

  pip install detectree2

On other systems the process is more involved especially if root access is not available.

See workflow `python-ci.yaml <https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2/tree/master/.github/workflows/python-app.yml>`_ workflow for a working CPU deployment.

Possible issues with GDAL 
-------------------------
GDAL presents a number of complexities. The issue is covered in `gdal/issue <https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2/issues/1>`_ We must point to the location of the preinstalled GDAL headers, and the GDAL version must match the pip package version. https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/2293
For instance, on my cluster::

    gdal-config -v  # gives 3.0.4

So this means we must install the corresponding pip version: ``GDAL==3.0.4`` or lower. To avoid problems, the version of the system GDAL should be higher than the version bindings.

    https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/188639/adding-gdal-as-dependency-to-python-package
In the event that GDAL does not exist on the system, install it as so (assuming root access)::

    sudo apt install libgdal-dev gdal-bin





===============================
Building Detectree2 using Conda
================================
Many of the aforementioned complexities with pip, GDAL and detectron2 can be solved with Conda. This is currently working for python 3.9.13, in branch `matt/conda <https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2/tree/matt/conda>`_. The most important file is `environment.yaml <https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2/blob/matt/conda/conda/environment.yaml>`_ which specifies the required dependencies. 

Install miniconda, and source (usually ``~/.miniconda/bin/activate`` if not in ``.bashrc`` already). Begin by installing ``mamba``::

    conda install mamba -c conda-forge

And then create the detectree2 environment:

    mamba env create -f envrironment.yaml 
    mamba activate detectree2env

Alternatively we may use a conda lock file which has transitive dependencies pinned. This improves reproducibility.::

    mamba create --name detectree2env --file conda-linux-64.lock

and if we modify our environment, we can update the lock file as so::

    conda-lock -k explicit --conda mamba

and then update conda packages based on the regenerated lock file::

    mamba update --file conda-linux-64.lock

The downside of this approach is that it takes much longer to install compared to pip, even with Mamba's improved dependency resolution. 

.. todo:: 

    * Determine how this can be integrated into current pip install without breaking ``colab`` pip deployment.
    * Investigate use of poetry as it is easier to package a distribution. But detectron2 is not PEP517 compliant. 
    * It is possible to combine Conda and Poetry, where Conda is used for packages like GDAL / detectron2 / openCV. 



To use detectree2, first install it using:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install detectree2
