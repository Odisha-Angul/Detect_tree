Python package for automatic tree crown delineation based on Mask R-CNN. Pre-trained models can be picked in the [`model_garden`](https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2/tree/master/model_garden).
A tutorial on how to prepare data, train models and make predictions is available [here](https://patball1.github.io/detectree2/tutorial.html). For questions, collaboration proposals and requests for example data email [James Ball](mailto:ball.jgc@gmail.com).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [gdal](https://gdal.org/download.html) geospatial libraries
- [PyTorch ≥ 1.8 and torchvision](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) versions that match
- For training models GPU access (with CUDA) is recommended

e.g.
```pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio```

## Installation

### pip

```pip install git+https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2.git```

Currently works on Google Colab (Pro version recommended). May struggle on clusters if geospatial libraries are not configured.
See [Installation Instructions](https://patball1.github.io/detectree2/installation.html) if you are having trouble.

### conda

*Under development*

## Getting started

Detectree2, based on the [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) Mask R-CNN architecture, locates trees in aerial images. It has been designed to delineate trees in challenging dense tropical forests for a range of ecological applications.

This [tutorial](https://patball1.github.io/detectree2/tutorial.html) takes you through the key steps. [Example Colab notebooks](https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2/tree/master/notebooks/colab) are also available.

The standard workflow includes:

1) Tile the orthomosaics and crown data (for training, validation and testing)
2) Train (and tune) a model on the training tiles
3) Evaluate the model performance by predicting on the test tiles and comparing to manual crowns for the tiles
4) Using the trained model to predict the crowns over the entire region of interest

Training crowns are used to teach the network to delineate tree crowns.

## Independent validation

> *Detectree2 (F1 score: 0.57) outperformed DeepForest (F1 score: 0.52)*
>
> *Detectree2 could estimate tree crown areas accurately, highlighting its potential and robustness for tree detection and delineation*
